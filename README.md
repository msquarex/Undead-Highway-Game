Can you drive a shopping cart along the spooky highway where AXES are ready to slash you and SKELETONS are determined to block your path. See how long you can survive before either the skeletons force you to drive off or maybe your poor driving skills. BE FAST though as the path below you might just disappear if you are slow enough.  Try to beat the HIGHSCORE!!! 

Used automatic terrain and obstacle generation and deletion to optimize the game and storage.
